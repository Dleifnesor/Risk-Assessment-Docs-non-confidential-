## Key Takeaways

from what I've found, nessus by itself leaves network blind spots open, In my testing using the trial versions of all these software is that we should use these tools in conjunction with one another, My best bet would be using auvik with nessus, as nessus's host discovery tool pales in comparison to that of auviks.
